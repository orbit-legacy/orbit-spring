Integration for using the Spring Framework to manage an Orbit Cluster.

## Actuator Support

Orbit Spring provides autoconfigured contributors to the 
[Spring Boot Actuator](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-actuator) endpoints, which activate
if Spring Boot Actuator is found in your project classpath. Spring Boot Actuator is an optional dependency of Orbit Spring.

### Health Indicator

The
[OrbitHealthIndicator](https://github.com/orbit/orbit-spring/blob/master/src/main/java/cloud/orbit/spring/actuate/OrbitHealthIndicator.java)
is a
[HealthIndicator](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v1.5.4.RELEASE/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/HealthIndicator.java) 
which contributes a health status of "UP" if the
[Stage](https://github.com/orbit/orbit/blob/master/actors/runtime/src/main/java/cloud/orbit/actors/Stage.java)
is running and the local node is alive. The health details are listed under the key "orbit" in the
[health endpoint](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-health).

```json
{
    "status": "UP",
    "orbit": {
        "status": "UP",
        "state": "RUNNING",
        "alive": true
    }
}
```

### Info Contributor

The
[ActorInfoContributorLifetimeExtension](https://github.com/orbit/orbit-spring/blob/master/src/main/java/cloud/orbit/spring/actuate/ActorInfoContributorLifetimeExtension.java)
is an
[InfoContributor](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v1.5.4.RELEASE/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/info/InfoContributor.java)
which aggregates info from
[Actor](https://github.com/orbit/orbit/blob/master/actors/core/src/main/java/cloud/orbit/actors/Actor.java)
implementation classes that implement the InfoContributor interface. The actors' info is listed under the key "actors"
in the
[info endpoint](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-application-info).

Suppose we have an actor defined as follows:

```java
public class MyActorImpl extends AbstractActor implements MyActor, InfoContributor {
    @Override
    public void contribute(final Info.Builder builder) {
        builder.withDetail("status", state().getStatus());
    }
    ...
}
```

If we activate two instances with identities "a" and "b", we might see this response from the `info` endpoint:

```json
{
    "actors": {
        "MyActor": {
            "a": {
                "status": {
                    "foo": false,
                    "bar": 0
                }
            },
            "b": {
                "status": {
                    "foo": true,
                    "bar": 42
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By default, actor info is grouped primarily by the actor interface, and secondarily by the actor identity. This is
customizable by setting the properties:

```yaml
management.info.actors.group.primary: NONE | INTERFACE | IDENTITY
management.info.actors.group.secondary: NONE | INTERFACE | IDENTITY
```
